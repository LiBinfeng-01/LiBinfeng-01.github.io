We are a group of people who are passionate about DMBS„ÄÅbig data technologies and Rust programming language.

We plan to contribute some database software developed using Rust to the open source community.

We'd like people who are flexible, quick to learn, self-driven and passionate, and have a database background to join us.

You can contact us in [Github](https://github.com/nothing-new-labs).
